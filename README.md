DESCRIPTION :This Python script automates the process of generating a sales performance report using the Pandas library. It begins by importing Pandas and reading sales data from a CSV file named data.csv into a DataFrame. The script then analyzes the data by calculating the total sales using the sum function and the average sales using the mean function. To identify individual performance, it finds the highest and lowest sales values using the idxmax and idxmin methods. Based on these indices, it extracts the corresponding rows to determine the top and lowest performers. After completing the analysis, the script formats the results into a well-structured text report using an f-string. The report includes total sales, average sales, and details of both the top and lowest performers. This formatted report is then saved to a text file named sales_report.txt. Finally, the program prints a confirmation message indicating that the report has been generated successfully.
